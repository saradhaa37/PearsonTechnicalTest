What are the different Performance Metrics you have come across in a Project and explain
what is done in each to ensure high quality with an example:

Solution:

=> Response time: 90,95,99 and average response time: 

-This is the most commonly used metric for any applications like API/UI which will be part of SLA in Test Plan
-These are the various response time used to measure against the user load with respect to the performance test types(stress test,load test,etc)
-There will be SLA set for the user journey against each test transactions(Eg: 5seconds)
-This will ensure and help to troubleshoot any issues (hardware/in code) in production environment

=> Server utilization: CPU and memory

-CPU      - Percentage of User and system time will be monitored and measured once the test is executed to ensure hardware stability
-Memory   - Percentage of memory utilized will be monitored during the test to ensure memory leak not occured and server is not overloaded with requests

=> TPS
-SLA will be set for overall test types(load test,stress test, ect) to ensure that system can handle anticipated load
-This will be monitored through testing tools during execution like ALM PC/ JMeter

=> Database metrics

-This will be reviewed to ensure if the query processing and thread lock not occured during test execution

Other than this below metrics and components are monitored to ensure successful load testing,
-> hits/second for each microservices in the APM tool (DataDog)
-> No of errors and type of error in APM and log anlyser tool like (New Relic and Kibana)
-> Network latency 
-> Monitoring specific application tools to ensure order(no of orders)/registration is successful
