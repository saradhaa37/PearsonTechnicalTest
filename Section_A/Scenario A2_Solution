What are the different Performance Metrics you have come across in a Project and explain
what is done in each to ensure high quality with an example:

Solution:
=> Response time: 90,95,99 and average response time: 
This is most commonly used metrics for any applications like API/UI which will be part of SLA in Test Plan
These are the various response time used to measure against the user load with respect to the performance test types(stress test,load test,etc)
90/95/99 Percentile response time will be set according to the application type
There will be SLA set for the user journey against the test scenarios(Eg: 5seconds).This again will ensure and troubleshoot any issues (hardware/in code) in production environment
