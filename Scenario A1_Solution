Describe common pitfalls of Performance testing and how to overcome that with an example for each of the pitfall.

1) Over estimated user load:
There are cases that Stakeholders/Client comeup with more user load for the performance testing that results in pressuring the system with wrong performance testing results
Solution:
=> We need to look at the current user load at analytics tools like Googleanalytics for the current user load 
=> We can also look at different production metrics => current user time, etc
=> We can look for scenario specific count.Eg: How many users created, how many orders made, how many sigup was successful etc
=> If its a cloud system we may also need to look at different metrics .Eg: like how many requests are allowed in particular AWS component
